This project uses Pipenv to manage its Python virtual environment and dependencies.

## Creating the Virtual Environment and Installing pytest

- Create virtual environment and install pytest as a dev dependency:

```bash
pipenv install --dev pytest
```
- Activate the virtual environment shell:

```bash
pipenv shell
```
- Deactivate shell when done:

```bash
exit
```
